# trilingo
Trilingo is a web app tailored for children aged 4-6, facilitating simultaneous learning of two mother tongue languages. Through Trilingo, children can easily learn new words by capturing photos of objects. The app not only identifies the objects but also teaches pronunciation. Trilingo currently supports Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Malay, and Tamil languages.
